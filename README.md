## Background

Created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I created in a past project. I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. The pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them. I deployed the website to GitHub pages.
